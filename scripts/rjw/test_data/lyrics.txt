[Intro]
Turn it up, turn it on, let the signal flow
One more tweak, watch the levels grow
Sweep the filter, ride the wave
We’re dialin’ in the sound we crave

[Chorus]
Test the tone, bend the air
Find the shape that’s really there
Turn the knob, adjust the phase
Searchin’ for that sweet upgrade
Echoes bounce, parameters sing
We’re tuning up everything

[Verse]
Latency’s low, the buffer’s clean
Crunching numbers in the machine
From white noise to melody
It’s all just code and symmetry
Drop a beat, reshape the pitch
One hot swap and flip the switch
"
[Instrumental]
